## Quick Start

To start using the components in your project, Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
    <link
        rel="stylesheet"
        href="https://poshui-components.netlify.app/css/main.css"
    />
```

Many of Posh UI components, like Modal, Toast, and others, require the use of JavaScript to function. For proper functioning of those, Copy-paste the following `<script>` near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them.

```html
    <script 
        src="https://poshui-components.netlify.app/js/main.js">
    </script>
```
